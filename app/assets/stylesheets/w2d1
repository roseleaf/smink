respond_to 
eg respond_to :html, :json
can be given to the class (model), then actions index, show, create can be given respond_with(@object)
if accessed by json this would return that object in json (a hash with another hash inside of it) (validates_for_ned )
Put something like this in the method if there is a possibility of not enough info being sent or something like this
  rescuq RestClient::UnprocessableEntity => e
    puts e response
  end

  begin
    ResctCLinet.poty('path.com/thing.json', {
    :thing => {
      :attribute => "here",
      :trait => "here"
    }

    })
  rescue RestClient::Exception => e
    puts e response
  end

if thing.save
  flash[:success] = "yay!" 
else
  flash[:failure] = "nooo!" 
end

"google broke?"
